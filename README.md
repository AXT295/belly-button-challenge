# belly-button-challenge

 In this task we are developing an interactive dashboard to explore Belly Button Biodiversity database, which contains data about the microbes that are invading human navels.
 
 The data reveals that in the study, more than 70% of individuals had a small number of microbial species which are also referred to as operational taxonomic units or OTUs and this was relatively rare.

 Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

 Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

 Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information. Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

 Update all the plots when a new sample is selected.

 Deploy the app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.
